# 2D Platformer Level Segmentation System
Easily segment your scene into different sections each with their own camera behavior, these sections are called level zones. Built in debugging visuals for the scene view make it easy to identify level zones while zoomed out. Transition zones known as entrances allow for defined camera placement when transitioning between levels. Combining entrances with the level zone's camera offset allows for highly customized camera-on-rails behavior. Level zones also support player tracking camera behavior using the "Player" tag and static positioning of the camera, both are accessible via the level zone's scroll direction. Entrances are set up to only trigger when player velocity is in the direction of their owning (parent) level zone. This behavior will only work for players with rigidbody or character controller components, custom solutions are not supported by default.
